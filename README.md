# Virtual Pet Project

This is a simple **Virtual Pet Simulator** built in Python.
It was created to practice **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and experiment with **GUI interaction** using `tkinter`.

## Features
- Each pet starts with default stats:
  - Hunger = 70
  - Energy = 70
  - Happiness = 70
  - Cleanliness = 70
- Stats are always clamped between **0-100** (so they never go out of range)
- If the pet's hunger reaches 0, a messagebox will appear notifying that your pet has passed

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xcindyyyx/virtual-pet-project.git
```
2. Run the program
```bash
python main.py
```
